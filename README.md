# Bikesharing
----- 
## Overview

In this assignment we will work to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal we will be analyzing bike sharing data to help visualize and present the data to stakeholders 

For this analysis, we'll be using Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we'll create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary

After looking at these results, we can conclude that the bikesharing service is a very successful business. Most users in the bike sharing service are males. We can also correlate that this service works well in NYC because people don't have cars of their own that they use on a day to day basis. With this service they don't even have to own the bike either. 

SUGGESTIONS:

1. Use the data to see what the revenue earned is each day is. This would be helpuful to understand the most profitable days and how to advertise properly. 

2. Use the data to figure out what the average stand by time is for the bikes in different ending point zones are.
